"Incorrect: 2 + 2 × 2 = 8
Correct: 2 + 2 × 2 = 6. The mistake is not following the order of operations (PEMDAS). Multiplication comes before addition."
"Incorrect: 10 ÷ 0.5 = 5
Correct: 10 ÷ 0.5 = 20. The mistake is not understanding that dividing by 0.5 is the same as multiplying by 2."
"Incorrect: 1/2 + 1/3 = 2/5
Correct: 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6. The mistake is adding numerators and denominators directly without finding a common denominator."
"Incorrect: 0.999... ≠ 1
Correct: 0.999... = 1. The mistake is not understanding that 0.999... is another representation of 1."
"Incorrect: √(16) = ±4
Correct: √(16) = 4. The mistake is confusing the square root function with solving the equation x² = 16."
"Incorrect: 5! = 100
Correct: 5! = 120. The mistake is confusing factorial with multiplication."
"Incorrect: 1/0 = ∞
Correct: 1/0 is undefined. The mistake is assuming division by zero yields infinity."
"Incorrect: (a + b)² = a² + b²
Correct: (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b². The mistake is not applying the binomial expansion correctly."
"Incorrect: 3.14 = π
Correct: 3.14 is an approximation of π, but π is an irrational number with infinite decimal places."
"Incorrect: 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25
Correct: 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25. This is actually correct, but many people think it's 0.5 due to confusion."
"Incorrect: 2² + 3² = 5²
Correct: 2² + 3² = 13, not 25. The mistake is assuming (a + b)² = a² + b²."
"Incorrect: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 100 = 5000
Correct: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 100 = 5050. The mistake is not using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series."
"Incorrect: 2^3 = 6
Correct: 2^3 = 8. The mistake is confusing exponentiation with multiplication."
"Incorrect: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/8
Correct: 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2. The mistake is adding denominators instead of numerators."
"Incorrect: 3 × 4 + 2 = 18
Correct: 3 × 4 + 2 = 14. The mistake is not following the order of operations (PEMDAS)."
"Incorrect: 10 - 5 × 2 = 10
Correct: 10 - 5 × 2 = 0. The mistake is not following the order of operations (PEMDAS)."
"Incorrect: 1/3 = 0.33
Correct: 1/3 ≈ 0.333..., which is a repeating decimal. The mistake is truncating the decimal prematurely."
"Incorrect: 8 ÷ 2(2+2) = 1
Correct: 8 ÷ 2(2+2) = 16. The mistake is due to incorrect application of PEMDAS. Division and multiplication have equal precedence and should be evaluated left to right."
"Incorrect: 4^0 = 0
Correct: 4^0 = 1. Any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 equals 1."
"Incorrect: log(100) = 10
Correct: log(100) = 2 (assuming base 10). The mistake is confusing logarithms with square roots."
"Incorrect: 1 mile = 5000 feet
Correct: 1 mile = 5280 feet. The mistake is underestimating the conversion."
"Incorrect: 100°C = 212°F
Correct: This is actually correct. The mistake is thinking it's wrong when it's right."
"Incorrect: (x + y)(x - y) = x² - y²
Correct: This is correct (difference of squares), but many think it equals x² + y²."
"Incorrect: 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3
Correct: 0.1 + 0.2 ≈ 0.30000000000000004 due to floating-point precision in computers."
"Incorrect: e = 2.718
Correct: e ≈ 2.71828... is an irrational number with infinite decimal places."
"Incorrect: sin(30°) = 0.5
Correct: This is correct, but many think sin(30) = 0.5 (radians vs degrees confusion)."
"Incorrect: 1 GB = 1000 MB
Correct: 1 GB = 1024 MB in binary systems (though some use decimal definition)."
"Incorrect: 1 inch = 3 cm
Correct: 1 inch ≈ 2.54 cm. The mistake is rounding too aggressively."
"Incorrect: 1 kg = 2 lbs
Correct: 1 kg ≈ 2.20462 lbs. The mistake is oversimplifying the conversion."
"Incorrect: 1 light year = time
Correct: 1 light year is a distance (how far light travels in a year)."
